Chest X-ray interpretation is a core clinical skill, yet many conditions share overlapping imaging features. This repository aims to:

Organize common and critical chest X-ray differentials

Map radiographic patterns → possible diagnoses

Support education, research, and AI/ML experimentation

Provide a structured reference for trainees and developers
